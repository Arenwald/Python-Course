Program quintanilla_sphere.py
Author: Carlos Quintanilla
Date: 05/24/2024

This program calculates the diameter, circumference, 
surface area, and volume of a sphere.
It promps the user for the radius of the sphere.
Results are rounded to 3 digit decimal.

Input: The radius as an int or floating-point number.

Output: Diameter, Circumference, Surface Area, and Volume of a Sphere.

Equations:
diameter: 2 * radius
circunference: diameter * PI
surface area: 4 * PI * radius * radius
volume: 4/3 * PI * radius * radius * radius

#Calculate diameter
diameter = 2 * radius

#calulate circumference
circumference = diameter * pi

#calculate surface area
surface_area = 4 * pi * radius * radius

#calculate volume
volume = 4/3 * pi * radius * radius * radius
